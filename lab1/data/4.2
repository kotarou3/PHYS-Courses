Two pulses now appear at A1, the first obviously being the transmitted signal and the second seemingly a reflected signal from the opposite end with a delay of about 9.3 +- 0.1 microseconds. The first maxima voltage of both the transmitted pulse and reflected pulse are recorded in volts.

Probing at various points along the transmission line, one can see the reflected pulse slowly adding together with the transmitted pulse as we go from A1 to A25. Once at A25, the received pulse is almost double the voltage of the transmitted pulse for the open line, while is zero for the closed line.

After removing the reflection on the line by adjusting the load resistance and minimising the pulse width (to reduce distortion), the load resistance was measured to be 50 Ohms (Actually, many values around 50 would also have worked, since the signal was still too distorted to adjust accurately).

Connecting the capacitor in parallel with the matched load resistance causes the reflection to return, and cannot be removed by adjusting the resistance again.
