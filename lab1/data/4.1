A1 is the input test point, while A25 is the output test point. A2 - A24 are intermediate test points into the line between A1 and A25, possibly or possibly not spaced spaced evenly.
Both input and output pulses become distorted in shape when connected to the transmission line. Pulse delay timings were measured from first maxima at A1, to the first maxima at A2 - A25, in microseconds. Uncertainty in all delay measurements are about 0.01 microseconds.

The further away from the input of the TL, the more attenuated and "spread out" the signal becomes.
