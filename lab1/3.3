Ambient temperature: 20-25 C

Spectrum readings (dark spectrum subtracted):
50.0 mA with 1 ms integration time and averaged over 50 readings
60.0 mA with 1000x attenuator and 20 ms integration time and averaged over 50 readings
99.7 mA with 1000x attenuator and 3 ms integration time and averaged over 50 readings

Power meter dark reading with 1000x attenuator: 0.5 mW
Power meter dark reading without 1000x attenuator: 1.1 uW
Errors less than decimal place

Output power seems to slowly decrease over time when increasing power, and increase when decreasing power. Waited for it to "mostly" stabilise before taking measurement (not change over 10 seconds).

HL6322G datasheet says absolute maximum optical output power is 15 mW, but I measured up to 50 mW?

Iin = input current in mA
Pout = output power in mW

With attenuator
Iin	Pout
0.4	0.5
25.0	0.5
50.0	0.8
52.5	0.8
53.8	1.6
55.0	2.4
62.5	9.1
75.0	21.1
87.5	33.6
99.7	45.5

Without attenuator
0.4	0.0011
12.5	0.0139
25.0	0.0342
37.5	0.0675
50.0	0.237
