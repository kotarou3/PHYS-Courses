Ambient temperature: 20-25 C

Power meter dark reading with 1000x attenuator: 0.5 mW
Power meter dark reading without 1000x attenuator: 0.8 uW
Errors less than decimal place

Set temperature: 23 C

Iin = input current in mA
Pout = output power in mW

With attenuator
Iin	Pout
40	0.8
45	4.8
50	12.1
55	20.2

Without attenuator
0	0.0035
20	0.0421
35	0.150
40	0.330

At this point, the power supply for the diode decided it did not want to work with any significant current (>40 mA).
Since the threshold current was above that value, it was impossible to continue to take any meaningful measurements.
Skipping this part of the experiment due to this.
