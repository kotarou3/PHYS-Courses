Following instructions as given in the student notes.

Laser output is oval shaped, with the "major axis" being cut off by the laser housing, so its diameter cannot be measured. Diameter roughly defined by eye, so measurement unlikely to be accurate.

dist = distance between laser and measurement plane, in mm
mDiam = minor axis diametre in measurement plane, in mm
D.... = error in measurement

dist	Ddist	mDiam	DmDiam
8	0.25	3.5	0.25
58	1	12	1
108	1	23	3
158	1	35	5
