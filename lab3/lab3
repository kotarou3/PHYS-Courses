Areas focused on for a while become brighter than other areas. Is the area being charged up?
Uncoated areas definitely charge up faster than coated areas. Uncoated areas seem to start deflecting electrons after a while, moving the recorded image.

At 5 kV, the styrofoam significantly distorted the image, almost acting like a "black hole"

All measurements done at a working distance of 11mm (?) and 30 kV at > x5k magnification

XR data saved in three formats (all have similar file names to the SE measurements):
- XR-<name>-data.txt: Raw spectroscope data
- XR-<name>.png: Plot of the spectroscope data along with overlaid spectral lines
- XR-<name>-elements.txt: Computed elemental composition data
