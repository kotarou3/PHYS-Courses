Using LDB instead of LDC since LDC didn't want to work.

Ramp duration: 50ms

Playing with the knobs got a differing number of peaks. Some of interest were saved below (average over 16 samples).

ALL0019, ALL0020: Zoomed out at 99.7mA
ALL0021: Same settings as ALL0020 but zoomed in
ALL0022: Same settings as ALL0020 but current near threshold (~60mA, could not decrease below threshold or nothing was visible)
