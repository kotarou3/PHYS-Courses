Power meter set to 532 nm, IR blocker put in place
~2.8 mW read on power meter despite no frequency doubling crystal in the cavity
Safety goggles had to be removed to see the green dot
~2.0 mW read with frequency doubling crystal in cavity regardless of crystal alignment (aligned = beam visible; unaligned = beam invisible to eye), so measurement is completely dominated by the IR, so pointless using the power meter to measure the power of the frequency doubled beam
Beam power also too unstable: significant changes in brightness over time just by leaving the laser on

SHG.txt: Spectrum measurement with dark spectrum removed; OD1 + IR absorber; 1ms integration time; Averaged over 50 scans

Cannot get green light emission if SHG crystal is placed outside the cavity
