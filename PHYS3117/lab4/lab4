SQUID with orange dot used

CH1: Current
CH2: Voltage
Mr SQUID x-axis: uA
Mr SQUID y-axis: uV

ALL**** data is saved directly from the oscilloscope (TBS 1072B-EDU)
ALL****-squid.tsv data is the same settings, but saved using Mr SQUID software instead

No numerical (easy) readout for flux and bias offsets (nor a way to set them with precision), so can't really include their settings in these notes.

Quite difficult to maximise the modulation depth voltage for part 2 - would jump up and down despite not touching the bias offset.

Part 1 readings:
ALL0000: Average 128, 500mV CH1&CH2 scale, 2.5ms time scale, Flux and Bias offset approximately vertical
ALL0003{,-squid.tsv}: Same as above, though adjusted to maximise positive knee

Part 2 readings:
ALL0001{,-squid.tsv}: Average 128, 500mV CH1 scale, 20mV CH2 scale, 2.5ms time scale
ALL0002{,-squid.tsv}: Same settings as above, but adjusted bias offset slightly

Part 3 readings:
All readings done at 14.01 GHz
ALL0004{,-squid.tsv}: Average 4, 500mV CH1&CH2 scale, 2.5ms time scale; Relatively clear 3 steps (<-6 dBm)
ALL0005{,-squid.tsv}: Save as above, but relatively clear 7 steps (-2.00 dBm)
ALL0006{,-squid.tsv}: Save as above, but relatively clear 9 steps (1.00 dBm)
