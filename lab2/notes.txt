Everything was done according to the instructions, unless otherwise noted.

Parts done on 2017-08-18 was before the "new" notes were released, so they were done using the old notes along with suggestions of extra things to do from the demonstrator.

Could not get any other beam profile than a spot (gaussian?). Either it would lase and produce a spot, or it does not lase.

Power meter set to 532 nm, IR blocker put in place
~2.8 mW read on power meter despite no frequency doubling crystal in the cavity
Safety goggles had to be removed to see the green dot
~2.0 mW read with frequency doubling crystal in cavity regardless of crystal alignment (aligned = beam visible; unaligned = beam invisible to eye), so measurement is completely dominated by the IR, so pointless using the power meter to measure the power of the frequency doubled beam
Beam power also too unstable: significant changes in brightness over time just by leaving the laser on

SHG.txt: Spectrum measurement with dark spectrum removed; OD1 + IR absorber; 1ms integration time; Averaged over 50 scans

Cannot get green light emission if SHG crystal is placed outside the cavity

Very consistent pulse widths, while fairly evenly well spaced repetitions.

Quite clear green light emission from the SHG crystal outside the cavity, even not in the path of the beam. Still requires removal of safety glasses to see though.

CavityL: Cavity length in mm (error = 1 mm)
PulseW: Pulse FWHM in ns (error = 0.2 ns)
PulseT: Pulse period (time until next pulse) in us

CavityL	PulseW	PulseT	DPulseT
26	12.9	184	16

Was unable to align laser for other cavity lengths.

Should have saved the raw data points for the above measurements, but already changed the alignment and could not restore it, by the time I realised I forgot...
