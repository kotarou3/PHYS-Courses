Very consistent pulse widths, while fairly evenly well spaced repetitions.

Quite clear green light emission from the SHG crystal outside the cavity, even not in the path of the beam. Still requires removal of safety glasses to see though.

CavityL: Cavity length in mm (error = 1 mm)
PulseW: Pulse FWHM in ns (error = 0.2 ns)
PulseT: Pulse period (time until next pulse) in us

CavityL	PulseW	PulseT	DPulseT

Was unable to align laser for other cavity lengths
