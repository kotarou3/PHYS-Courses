Dettol
------
Rotating wave plate changes intensity of scattered light in direction of viewing.

Minima occurs on a horizontal viewing plane when half wave plate's fast axis is set to 45(5) degrees. Therefore, laser is vertically polarised upon entering the half wave plate.

Ajax
----
Same as Dettol, but less scattering intensity in general
